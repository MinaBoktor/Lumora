### Key Components Explained

*   **Content Script (`content.js`)**: This is the workhorse of Lumora, injected directly into every webpage you visit. It's responsible for:
    *   Detecting text selections.
    *   Applying the visual highlighting styles.
    *   Managing the persistence and restoration of highlights on the page.
    *   Handling interactions with highlighted text (e.g., removing individual highlights).
    *   Communicating with the popup and background scripts.
*   **Background Script (`background.js`)**: Running in the background, this service worker handles:
    *   Creating and managing the right-click context menu options.
    *   Listening for extension installation events.
    *   Setting default user preferences.
    *   Facilitating communication between the content script and the popup, especially for updates to the highlight list.
*   **Popup (`popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`)**: This is the user interface that appears when you click the Lumora icon in your toolbar. It allows you to:
    *   Select your preferred highlighting color.
    *   View a list of all highlights on the current page.
    *   Jump to specific highlights on the page.
    *   Remove individual highlights.
    *   Clear all highlights from the page.
    *   Export your highlights.
    *   Access basic settings like auto-save and notifications.
*   **Storage System**: Lumora utilizes Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API for primary data persistence, complemented by `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` for robust, multi-layered local backups. This ensures your data is always safe and recoverable.

Encountering an issue? Here are some common solutions:

### Storage Issues

*   **Automatic Backup**: Lumora automatically uses its backup storage if Chrome's primary storage encounters issues.
*   **Regular Export**: For critical data, regularly use the export feature to create external backups.
*   **Browser Data**: Clearing your browser's data (cache, cookies, local storage) may remove your highlights. Be cautious when performing such actions.

### Performance Issues

*   **Optimization**: Lumora is highly optimized to prevent performance degradation and flickering.
*   **Other Extensions**: If you experience slowness, try temporarily disabling other Chrome extensions to check for conflicts.
